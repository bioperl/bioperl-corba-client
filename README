Bioperl Corba Client is a collection of modules which makes Biocorba
objects look like Bioperl objects.

The most important thing which this does is handle memory. As Corba is
agnostic about memory management, these objects handle the memory
communication with the server (the biocorba system has its own memory
management convention)

The second thing is that it provides breathing space between bioperl and
biocorba. This way bioperl can evolve separately to biocorba, providing
interoperability with stiffling each project.

For more details of the biocorba project, the most developed distribution
is the bioperl-corba-server.

INSTALLATION
------------

You need to have two components installed on your machine for
Biocorba to work:

   orbit (comes installed by default in redhat linux)
   CORBA::ORBit (available from cpan)

Bioperl-corba-client installs as a standard CPAN module

Type the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
<become-root>
make install

If you can't become root go

perl Makefile.PL LIB=/somewhere/you/can/write/to


RUNNING THE TESTS 
-------

Because the tests are dependant on a server being available it is
necessary that links or copies of the IOR files and biocorba.idl 
are setup correctly.

If you want to run the DB.t test (the only one currently), you will 
need to start the servers/seqdbsrv.pl in bioperl-corba-server or
some other CORBA SeqDB server.  You will need an IOR file called
seqdbsrv.ior (see t/DB.t for more info) in the client root dir 
(bioperl-corba-client-0.2 in the dist case).
