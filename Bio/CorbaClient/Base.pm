=head1 NAME

Bio::CorbaClient::Base - Base class for all Corba Client wrappers

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for all Biocorba client wrappers. This class 
provides the simple memory management model which is crucial to make
sure we don't leave objects forever on the server side. The memory
management happens via ref/unref calls - generally we will never touch
ref as (from our perspective) we only ever get on object. unref is 
important (duh!).

Base also provides a standard new object and inheriets from Bio::Root::RootI
so we can throw nicely.
